1. Consistency:
color,font,alignment is the same and then the navigation bar is in the same place not making it confusing

2. Shortcuts:
the button on navigation brings users to the page they want to visit

3. Informative feedback:
After sending the msg user gets notification that message is sent

4. Design dialogs to yield closure:
just like before after filling all of the form when the user press submit it will show that the user has completed
the action giving them a feel of satisfaction

5. simple file error handling:
When the person tried to send the message if there is blank place it will show error

6. Permit easy reversal of actions
Put shortcut key at the bottom left for user to go back up rather than scrolling back down the website

7. Support internal locus of control
The design lets the user roam freely with no limitations and give them options if they either want to message or not 

8. Reduce short-term memory load
the website layout is really simple with minimal informations making it easy to remmember
